# Attractions
In the past, Neiwan Old Street was the main road in and out of the Jianshi Mountain area rich in forests and minerals. Because of this, it brought a lot of people to Neiwan in the 1950s. The streets mainly developed from Zhongzheng Road to Guangfu Road, Datong Road, Heping Street, Zhongshan Street and Guangji Road, which were all crowded with people. However, with the decline of the forestry and mining industries, Neiwan's prosperity also went from noisy to quiet.
