# Attractions
Jiufen, which was rich in gold mines in the early days, was known as the "Golden Mountain City". The settlement prospered due to the influx of gold miners, but later became quiet as the gold rush declined. In the late 1980s, the movie "A City of Sadness" came to Jiufen for filming. Jiufen's beautiful mountains and seas, retro buildings and unique slope landscapes jumped onto the big screen, making it an aesthetic mountain city that fascinated domestic and foreign tourists.
